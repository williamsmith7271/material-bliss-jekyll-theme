## Material Theme for Jekyll!

#### created with React, Redux, React-Router and transpiled with Webpack.

##### All the awesomeness of Material UI without the hassle of JQuery and servers, built with the latest web technologies!

Made with React and served statically

in order to build:
```
./build-dev.sh //for development build
./build-prod.sh //for production build
```

#### ./react-dev/pages
These are static Jekyll components being rendered with react-dev


### TODO:
 - [x] create a jekyll plugin to output all [YML config] site data into JSON, in such a way which is importable to react and can be used to manage state
 - [x] [possible TODO, maybe redundant. ?] create a react plugin to manage state generated by jekyll. Make it do other tasks such as generate react components to static HTML which can be used by Jekyll (where it makes sense. For example, rendering post.html in order to not skimp on SEO)
