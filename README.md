## Material Theme for Jekyll!

#### created with React, Redux, React-Router and transpiled with Webpack.

##### All the awesomeness of Material UI without the hassle of JQuery and servers, built with the latest web technologies!

#### Now Includes Extra Overengineeringness!

Made with React and served statically

in order to build:
```
./build-dev.sh //for development build
./build-prod.sh //for production build
```

`./react-dev/pages`
These are static Jekyll components being rendered with react


### TODO:
 - [x] create a jekyll plugin to output all [YML config] site data into JSON, in such a way which is importable to react and can be used to manage state
 - [x] [possible TODO, maybe redundant. ?] Rendered JS to HTML and outputted into a folder for Jekyll to take it. This allows us to use React components on `_layouts`
